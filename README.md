# "WEATHER" TO LAND?

* How do you keep your airport _accident-free_ in bad weather?
* _Human errors_ have led to numerous aircraft accident in the past...
* What if there is a way to _automate the decision_ whether it is a safe to land/take-off?
* And what if that can be achieved via _seamless communication_?


## Introduction
WEATHER TO LAND? is a safeguard programme between the control tower and aircrafts.

It helps air traffic controllers
1. to instruct aircrafts to land/take-off in fine weather and to confirm the result
2. to instruct aircrafts NOT to land/take-off in stormy weather
3. to instruct aircrafts NOT to land when the airport is full
4. to check the status of aircrafts (airbourne or on-ground)

It is built to adapt to airports of any size by allowing the user to amend airport capacity accordingly.


## Implementation
There are three classes:
1. ControlTower
2. Aircraft
3. Airport
